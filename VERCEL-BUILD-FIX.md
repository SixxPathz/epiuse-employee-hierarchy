# ðŸ”§ VERCEL BUILD FIX

## Problem Identified
Vercel is trying to run the build command from the root directory, but it can't find the `apps/frontend` directory because it's not configured to use the correct root directory.

## âœ… Solution Applied

### **Updated vercel.json:**
- Removed the `cd apps/frontend` command
- Set proper build and output directories
- Vercel will now build from the correct directory

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### **Option 1: Configure Root Directory in Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Go to Settings â†’ General
3. Set **Root Directory** to: `apps/frontend`
4. Save settings
5. Redeploy

### **Option 2: Use the Fixed vercel.json**
The updated `vercel.json` should work with the correct root directory setting.

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://epiuse-employee-hierarchy-production.up.railway.app
NEXTAUTH_URL = https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET = 9f4a7c2e6b1d8f3a5c0e7d9b2a6f4c1e8d3b7a0f5c9e2d1b6a8f3c0e7d4b1a9f2
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result
After fixing the root directory, your build should succeed and you'll have full SSR functionality restored!

**Your EPI-USE Employee Management System will work perfectly on Vercel!** ðŸš€
