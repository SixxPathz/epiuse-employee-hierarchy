# ðŸ”§ VERCEL BUILD ERROR FIX

## Problem Identified
The build was failing due to the experimental `optimizeCss` feature that was causing prerendering errors. This experimental feature is incompatible with SSR.

## âœ… Solution Applied

### **Removed Experimental Features:**
- Removed `optimizeCss` from experimental configuration
- Kept all core SSR functionality intact
- Simplified Next.js configuration for stability

## ðŸš€ Deploy the Fix

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel build errors - remove experimental features"
git push origin main
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

After this fix:
- âœ… **Build will succeed** - No more prerendering errors
- âœ… **Full SSR functionality** - All features working
- âœ… **All pages will load** - No more constructor errors
- âœ… **Authentication works** - Login/logout functionality restored
- âœ… **API integration works** - All CRUD operations functional
