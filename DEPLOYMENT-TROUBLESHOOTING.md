# üö® Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issues & Solutions

### 1. **404 Error on Login**
**Problem**: Frontend can't reach backend API endpoints
**Solution**: Update API URLs in deployment configuration

### 2. **Environment Variables Missing**
**Problem**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` not set in Netlify
**Solution**: Configure environment variables in both services

### 3. **CORS Errors**

## üîß Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Get Your Actual URLs

1. **Railway Backend URL**: 
   - Go to Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your backend service
   - Copy the URL (looks like: `https://epiuse-backend-production-abc123.up.railway.app`)

2. **Netlify Frontend URL**:
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Your site
   - Copy the URL (looks like: `https://amazing-site-name.netlify.app`)

### Step 2: Update Netlify Configuration

1. **Update `netlify.toml`**:
   ```toml
   # Replace with your actual Railway URL
   [[redirects]]
     from = "/api/*"
     to = "https://YOUR-ACTUAL-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/api/:splat"
     status = 200
     force = true
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables in Netlify**:
   - Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add these variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL = https://YOUR-ACTUAL-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app
   NEXTAUTH_URL = https://YOUR-ACTUAL-NETLIFY-URL.netlify.app
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET = 9f4a7c2e6b1d8f3a5c0e7d9b2a6f4c1e8d3b7a0f5c9e2d1b6a8f3c0e7d4b1a9f2
   ```

### Step 3: Update Railway Configuration

1. **Update Environment Variables in Railway**:
   - Go to Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your backend service ‚Üí Variables
   - Update `FRONTEND_URL`:
   ```
   FRONTEND_URL = https://YOUR-ACTUAL-NETLIFY-URL.netlify.app
   ```

### Step 4: Seed Production Database

Run this command to create test users:
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR-ACTUAL-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/api/admin/seed-production \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-seed-secret: epiuse-seed-2025" \
  -d '{}'
```

### Step 5: Test Login Credentials

After seeding, use these credentials:
- **Admin**: `thabo.mthembu@epiuse.com` / `securepassword123`
- **Manager**: `sipho.ngcobo@epiuse.com` / `securepassword123`
- **Employee**: `kagiso.morake@epiuse.com` / `securepassword123`

Should return: `{"status": "OK", "timestamp": "..."}`

### Check Frontend Build
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Deploys
2. Check build logs for errors
3. Verify all files are in the `out` directory

### Check Browser Console
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try to login
4. Look for failed requests (red entries)
5. Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
