# 🔧 CORS ERROR FIX

## Problem Identified
Your Railway backend isn't allowing requests from your Vercel domain due to CORS policy. The backend needs to be configured to accept requests from Vercel domains.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### **Updated Backend CORS Configuration:**
- Added `/\.vercel\.app$/` regex pattern to allow all Vercel domains
- Kept existing Netlify support for backward compatibility
- Maintained development localhost support

## 🚀 Deploy Backend Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CORS for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

## 🔧 Update Railway Environment Variables

In Railway Dashboard → Your backend service → Variables:

```
FRONTEND_URL = https://epiuse-employee-hierarchy.vercel.app
```

**Important:** Make sure this is your actual Vercel URL, not the placeholder.

## 🎯 Expected Results

After deploying the backend changes and updating the environment variable:

- ✅ **CORS errors resolved** - Vercel can make requests to Railway
- ✅ **Login functionality works** - Authentication will succeed
- ✅ **All API calls work** - CRUD operations functional
- ✅ **Full app functionality restored** - Everything works as expected

## 🔍 How to Check Your Vercel URL

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Copy the deployment URL (should be something like `https://epiuse-employee-hierarchy.vercel.app`)
4. Use this exact URL in Railway's `FRONTEND_URL` variable
